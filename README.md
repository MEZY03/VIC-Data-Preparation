# VIC-Data-Preparation
This repository provides a set of Python script tools for preparing input data for the VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) hydrological model. The project aims to automate the entire process from raw data downloading to generating VIC-recognized parameter files, helping researchers quickly set up VIC model experimental environments.
